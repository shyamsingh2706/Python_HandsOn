# Given two strings str1 and str2, the task is to find the length of the shortest string that has both str1 and str2 as subsequences.

#Input:   str1 = "geek",  str2 = "eke"
#Output: 5
#Explanation:
#String "geeke" has both string "geek" and "eke" as subsequences.

# Solution Explanation:
# We need to find a string that has both strings as subsequences and is shortest such string.
# If both strings have all characters different, then result is sum of lengths of two given strings.
# If there are common characters, then we donâ€™t want them multiple times as the task is to minimize length.
# Therefore, we first find the longest common subsequence, take one occurrence of this subsequence and add extra characters.
# Length of the shortest supersequence   = (Sum of lengths of given two strings)  - (Length of common LCS of two given strings)
